Guidelines for the project solution

Guidelines for the project solution:

The input and output formats are provided/available for each of the 3 projects.

There is a lot of flexibility in terms of how to get from the input to the output.

Some suggestions are made but are not enforced.

It is good to wait until we learn numpy and pandas to start implementing the project.

Until then try to break the project down into functions/tasks for each team member.

Define the input and output for each tasks so that team members can work independently. 

You can create your own small test data for your task and make sure it works as expected.

When all tasks are done put them together and run them on the input data for the project.

Do not repeat code, use functions and other control structures if possible.

Do not hard-code (provide input data in the code).

Try to avoid hard-coding by using variables to store the data (such as file names) and then use the variables in the code that follows.

This is specifically important for functions and function parameters.

Try to simplify your solution, do not use convoluted code.

Less code means less chance for errors, so simplify.

Use existing functionality when available, don't reinvent the wheel.
