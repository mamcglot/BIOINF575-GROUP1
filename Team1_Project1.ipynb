I wanted to ensure that the entire team could easily locate the relevant files and understand the tasks assigned to them.\n",

I gained an appreciation of working on a collaboratory project and how to ensure working code that integrates with other tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  I am very interested in examining whether certain genotypes confer higher efficacy regarding drugs and their associated diseases. It would also be very interesting in visualizing the proportions of different categories (i.e. histograms, raincloud plots) and validating with sensitivity analyses to see if there is correspondence with the 23_and_me allele variant calls versus the PharmGKB variant calls.\n"

    "1. When completing the task, my main challenge was understanding the file read and save paths. Since we were using Google shared files, it was somewhat different from operating on my own computer.

I really enjoyed the task assigned to me because it not only helped me understand file reading and handling in a shared environment, but also, being a task in the middle of the sequence, I learned some methods to improve accuracy by analyzing the preceding code. For instance, testing with a subset of data before the full analysis.\n",

    "1. The biggest challenge for me was the \"split\" part. In this dataset, the data is not stored in a tidy way. It includes several gene symbols or drug names in the same row. It is important to notice those \"different\" cells in the data frame and think carefully about how to deal with those \"weird\" or \"different\" cells in the dataset. The details needed to be taken into account is much more than I expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. I learned that always skim through the dataset before you try to deal with it. Sometimes, observing the first several lines is not enough. I should think more carefully and consider the potential problems when processing the data. Additionally, the output of the later coding part can help you to be aware of some details you ignored during coding. I realized some details were ignored and went back to modify my code when I saw the output in task 6.\n",

    "3. I am interested in combining this dataset with clinical trial data to explore the genetic association with drug response for a specific disease/disease type. We could identify if some common genetic variants can influence drug effectiveness for the disease. We could also explore the reasons behind the commonly used drug or more efficient drug in clinical trials based on gene or genetic variant level."

Since this project was the first coding project for me, I would not sure that if my code was readable for others who worked with me.\n",

It might be  possible to analyze which drugs show more interaction with the gene therefore could narrow down the number of drugs and do more specific study."

    "We initially investigated how this SNP is related to genes. In our list, most \"rs1801133\" is related to gene MTHFR with 21 drugs and also related to gene CLCN6 with only one drug. \"rs1801133\" is a SNP on the gene MTHFR, responsible for encoding the MTHFR protein involved in methylation pathway [2]. CLCN6 is identified as an MTHFR overlap gene, explaining why CLCN6 is also included in gene associated with this SNP in our dataset. A literature identified another variant on CLCN6 (rs9651118) and indicates that CLCN6 (rs9651118) and MTHFR gene (C667T rs1801133) are significantly associated with a higher risk of keratinocyte cancer in renal transplant recipients [2]. However, there is no specific research on the association between gene CLCN6 and variant \"rs1801133\". This observation, derived from our new feature's output, could facilitate further research on gene CLCN6 and variant \"rs1801133\"."

    "Then we tried to explore the impacts of this SNP on diseases. Gene variants in the MTHFR are suggested to be associated with vascular diseases, thromboembolism, neural tube defects, schizophrenia, cancers, as well as neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease [3].  \"rs1801133\" variant has been mostly reported to be associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD) or coronary disease. It is found that \"rs1801133\" is significantly associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD) in the European and Asian populations via meta-analysis [4]. Based on our list for \"rs1801133,\" researchers can explore the effectiveness or performance of the \"rs1801133\" variant-related drugs for Parkinson's disease (PD)."

    "Additionally, our data can be utilized for personalized drug treatment plans. For each SNP, we can delve into their associations with drug metabolism or drug efficacy by consulting relevant drug response databases or research literature.\n",

    "In the data we have acquired, we specifically focused on the correlation between antipsychotic drugs and rs1801133. By searching for [rs1801133 on the PharmGKB website](https://www.pharmgkb.org/variant/PA166153644/variantAnnotation),\n",
    " we found statistically significant variant annotations. Specifically, we learned that compared to allele A, allele G is associated with an increase in body weight in patients with affective disorders and schizophrenia receiving antipsychotic drug treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This discovery provides robust support for formulating personalized drug treatment plans. By thoroughly examining the genetic information of patients, particularly emphasizing the alleles of rs1801133, physicians can more accurately predict the likelihood of weight gain in patients receiving antipsychotic drug treatment. This offers crucial guidance for physicians to adjust treatment plans, choose drugs more suitable for patients, or modify drug dosages, aiming to enhance treatment efficacy and reduce the potential risk of adverse reactions."
