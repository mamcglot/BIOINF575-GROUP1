1451834452	CYP3A4*1, CYP3A4*17	CYP3A4	nifedipine	15634941	Other, Metabolism/PK	not stated	in vitro expression of the recombinant CYP3A4*17 allelic protein and the wild-type protein	CYP3A4 *17 is associated with decreased metabolism of nifedipine as compared to CYP3A4 *1.	*17			Is	Associated with	decreased	metabolism of					*1	
1451159680	rs5031016	CYP2A6	warfarin	22248286	Dosage	no	No association was found between this variant and warfarin-maintenance dose. Described as CYP2A6*7 in this study.	Allele G is not associated with increased dose of warfarin in people with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0-3.0 as compared to allele A.	G			Is	Not associated with	increased	dose of		in people with	Other:an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0-3.0		A	
1183684657	CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizer genotype	CYP2D6	tramadol	18204346	Metabolism/PK	yes	Median (+)R,R-tramadol area under the curve was 2386 +/- 681 mg.h.L in PMs and 667 +/- 243 mg.h.L in UMs.  Median (-)S,S-tramadol area under the curve was 2370 +/- 631 mg.h.L in PMs and 561 +/- 193 mg.h.L in UMs.The UM group consisted of subjects with one active duplication allele (*1x2,*2x2,*35x2,*41x2) and one active allele (*1,*2,*9,*10,*35,*41). The PM group consisted of subjects with both alleles from the group *3,*4,*5,*6.	CYP2D6 ultra-metabolizer genotype is associated with increased metabolism of tramadol in healthy individuals as compared to CYP2D6 poor metabolizer genotype.			ultrarapid metabolizer genotype	Is	Associated with	increased	metabolism of		in healthy individuals				poor metabolizer genotype
1451306860	CYP2C9*11	CYP2C9	warfarin	33350885	Dosage	not stated	"""This case suggests that CYP2C9 *11/*11 carriers require approximately two thirds less warfarin than CYP2C9"" normal function homozygotes."	CYP2C9 *11/*11 is associated with decreased dose of warfarin.	*11/*11			Is	Associated with	decreased	dose of						
1448997750	CYP2B6*1, CYP2B6*18	CYP2B6	efavirenz	16495778	Metabolism/PK	yes	Please note that in the paper the allele was referred to as CYP2B6*16. CYP2B6*16 and *18 alleles have been consolidated by PharmVar in Jan 2020, with *16 now listed as a suballele of *18 (CYP2B6*18.002). This annotation is updated to be on CYP2B6*18, instead of CYP2B6*16.	CYP2B6 *1/*18 is associated with increased concentrations of efavirenz in people with HIV Infections as compared to CYP2B6 *1/*1.	*1/*18			Is	Associated with	increased	concentrations of		in people with	Disease:HIV Infections		*1/*1
